**JawHare Framework**

This is intended to be a simple PHP framework.  In all reality it is closer to a library than a full framework.

The key concepts I'm going for are:
* Keep things simple
* If you don't need it then don't load it
* Don't piss off the developers trying to make things "simple"
* Don't force developers to do things a particular way

**How to Contribute**

I welcome all code contributions.  The ideal method is to use GitHub's practice of forking the repository and making a pull request.

1. Fork the repository and clone it
2. Commit your changes making sure to sign-off that you certify the changes are under the license of the project per the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/mikemill/JawHare/blob/master/DCO.txt)
3. Push your changes to your repository
4. Create a pull request to the main repository.  See [Pull requests](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests) for more information.
